                    <h1>Abstract</h1>
                    <p>In our project we are attempting to create a classifier
                            that is able to predict whether or not a
                            player will be drafted solely based upon their
                            performance at the NFL combine. Every year
                            there is an extremely large amount of interest
                            surrounding the combine, with both fans and
                            teams eager to determine when or if a player
                            should be drafted. The statistics we used were
                            mostly related to physical ability, such as lifting,
                            running, and agility. The amount of money
                            and research that goes into player performance
                            is continually growing, which is why we hoped to
                            determine the overall importance of these factors
                            on a playerâ€™s prospects in the NFL.</p>
                    <p>Our initial approach was to use decision trees
                            to develop a set of rules that would classify players
                            based upon their physical abilities as well as
                            position, college, height, and several other features.
                            We believed this, or nearest neighbor,
                            would allow us to create accurate models based
                            on the basic intuition that the physical ability
                            was highly correlated with draft prospects. This,
                            however, proved to not be the case as we found
                            very little improvement with these models over
                            ZeroR. From here we began to spend a great deal
                            of time on transforming our dataset to interact
                            variables and spread out possible distributions.
                            We found this to improve the accuracies of several
                            classifiers we explored, but by very little</p>
                    <p>Even through the use of decision trees, logistic
                            regressions, and many other models, our best
                            classifier only proved to be 2 % more accurate
                            than ZeroR. We discuss these results in more details,
                            as well as their several implications in the
                            attached report.</p>
